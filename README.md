	# dummy_banking_sys

Am reworking my C programming skill on this repository.
It's been adopted from [geeksfogeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bank-account-system-in-c-using-file-handling/)

Each branch will progressivelly tackle every aspect  of C programming ever learnt,from  compiling, dynamic linking, file handling etc.
The branches will be named by the aspect or concept.

In the end I should have an api, and three UIs -a terminal, destop ui and web UI. So help me code :sweat:

unrelated, I happen to interacted with CODECO - Computerised Departure Control' system as a user.
